## Overview

In this assignment you will:

* Make a fork of the [PlaygroundProjectStarter][pps] repository on GitHub so that you have your own copy of the code.
* Use Git to _clone_ the repository to your computer.
* Configure Unity to build a WebGL version of one of the example games.
* Build the game.
* Add it to your GitHub Pages website.
* Push your game to GitHub to publish it on your website.

## Publishing your first game

We'll work through this togething in class for the first time, but you may want to make notes or come back here to review the steps

### Forking the repository on GitHub

On GitHub a _[fork][]_ is a copy of another repository. We'll need to make a fork of the [PlaygroundProjectStarter][pps] code so that you can modify it and keep track of your changes. Here's what to do:

1. **Follow this link to the master [PlaygroundProjectStarter][pps] repository.**
1. Look for the **Fork button** in the upper right hand corner of the browser window.
1. Click on the button to create your own copy of the [PlaygroundProjectStarter][pps] code.

### Cloning the repository to your local computer

1. Before leaving the browser, click on the green Clone or download dropdown menu button.
1. You will see a clipboard icon on the right side of the repository URL. Click on it to make a copy of the URL.
1. Then, on your computer, **find the `Git Bash` command and launch it.** Git Bash is a Windows version of the Unix shell (command interperter) Bash – it is very similar to the Windows command prompt, the biggest difference that you are likely to notice is that the path seperator is the forward slash (/) instead of the backslash (\\).
1. Then, **c**hange **d**irectories to your class folder by typing:

  ```bash
  cd /u/<the name of your game design folder>
  ```
