## Overview

In this assignment you will:

* Make a fork of the [PlaygroundProjectStarter][pps] repository on GitHub so that you have your own copy of the code.
* Use Git to _clone_ the repository to your computer.
* Configure Unity to build a WebGL version of one of the example games.
* Build the game.
* Add it to your GitHub Pages website.
* Push your game to GitHub to publish it on your website.

## Working on the command line

## Publishing your first game

We'll work through this togething in class for the first time, but you may want to make notes or come back here to review the steps

### Forking the repository on GitHub

On GitHub a _[fork][]_ is a copy of another repository. We'll need to make a fork of the [PlaygroundProjectStarter][pps] code so that you can modify it and keep track of your changes. Here's what to do:

1. On your computer, **find the `Git Bash` command and launch it**. Git Bash is a Windows version of the Unix shell (command interperter) Bash – it is very similar to the Windows command prompt, the biggest difference that you are likely to notice is that the path seperator is the forward slash (/) instead of the backslash (\).
